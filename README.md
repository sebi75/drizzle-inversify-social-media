This is not a production ready project. It is just a sample project mainly
created for learning purposes ( and also for fun ).

The purpose of this repository is to display
how to create a project using the haxagonal architecture pattern with inversify
in a nodejs application with cutting edge ORM drizzle and message broker RabbitMQ
with publisher-consumer pattern where it makes sense ( like feed generations )
